React is made of components, implemented with a js class, state and render
State == data to display when component rendered
Render == what UI looks like; outputs react element

React auto communicates with DOM
So only have to change component states and react react to the state and auto updates DOM to match that state

First download node.js
Shell: npm i -g create-react-app
Download code editor (like Atom)
In editor, download "simple react snippets" & "prettier - code formatter"
In editor, in user settings write "editor.formatOnSave: true"

Shell: create-react-app react-tutorial
